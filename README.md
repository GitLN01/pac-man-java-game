# About Pac-Man
Pac-Man is an arcade game developed by Namco and distributed under license in the United States by Midway, 
first released in Japan on May 22, 1980. Extremely popular in the United States from the day of its release until today, 
Pac-Man is universally considered one of the classics of this medium, practically synonymous with video games and one of the 
icons of popular culture of the 1980s. After its release, this game became a social phenomenon.

## How to play:
• The player controls Pac-Man, who must collect all the food (called "Pellets") inside the closed maze while avoiding the 
colored ghosts. The more points he collects, the higher the score, and if he comes into contact with the spirit 3 times, 
the game ends and the number of points is canceled. The time of passing the game is not limited.

• The maximum number of points is 300, and if the player achieves that number of points, an optional dialogue appears with
the message that he has won and if he wants to restart the game, and if he loses 3 lives, an optional dialog also appears 
with the message that he has lost and if he wants to to restart the game ("Yes" - the window does not close, the game restarts 
and deletes the number of points and lives that the player previously had, pacman and ghosts return to their original place and 
fill the empty spaces with dots, "No" – the window closes).

• Pac-man moves around the map with the help of the arrows on the keyboard.
